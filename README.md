NOTE: 

I have linked my malicious DLL along with my submission of the executable. This was to ensure if the testing computer does not have gcc compiler installed, the malware will still be able to run. That being said, if the computer does have gcc installed, you will receive an error when trying to create "maahum-malware.dll" because it will already exist. However, the malware will still be able to run for testing purposes. 

If gcc compiler is installed on the machine, feel free to delete the dll and run the malware to see the full extent of the DLL injection within a dynamic and reverse engineering analysis.
